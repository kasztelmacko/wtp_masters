# Master Thesis survey

This project was written to run a survey for my Masters Thesis, as I haven't found any other convinient way to integrate both: 
- AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Processing), and 
- CBC (Choice Based Conjoint) methods.



 



# Stack:
- backend: FastAPI
- frontend: React
- deployed: docker image on Google Cloud Run

*the page survey can be accesed on ``wafl.ovh``
